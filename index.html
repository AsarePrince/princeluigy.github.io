    <h1><b><u>World's Biggest Barbering Shop</u></b></h1>
    <p>We believe men’s haircuts are NOT one size ﬁts all. We are the anti-barber. No clippers. We are 100% scissor over comb which means every haircut we give is tailored to the individual, taking into consideration hair texture, hair direction, face structure/shape, personal style and desired look to achieve a result most men didn’t even know was possible for their hair. Fleischman Flow means having a haircut that grows out beautifully so it looks just as good on day 60 as it did on day 1. No one has time to get a haircut every two weeks because their hair sticks up in weird places a week after a haircut or because it’s a struggle to style. Our clients can go up to 4 – 8 weeks between haircuts and love the way their hair looks at every stage. </p>

             <h3>Barbering Shop Interior</h3>
             <p>A customer’s first impression is formed before they’ve even interacted with anyone. Is the shop clean, organised, and inviting? The last thing you want is for a new customer to feel awkward or confused when they walk in, so be sure to lay out the shop in a logical manner. In a barbershop, the first person the client usually sees is the receptionist, who should have a friendly, approachable expression. The customer should be greeted by the receptionist or first point of contact in the shop, and asked how they can be helped.</p>
