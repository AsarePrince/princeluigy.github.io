    <p><u>A customer’s first impression is formed before they even interacted with anyone. Is the shop clean, organised and inviting? The last thing you want is for a new customer to feel awkward or confused when they walk in, so be sure to lay out the shop in a logical manner. In a barbershop, the first person the client usually sees is the receptionist, who should have a friendly, approachable expression. The customer should be greeted by the receptionist or first point of contact in the shop, and asked how they can be helped.<br><b>Blog</b>At BARBERÍA, your health is our concern, that is why our tools and equipments are stabilised and to prevent people from getting infected. Our personnel’s will ask every customer who comes to the shop if he has had a case of bacteria or fungus infection in his hair so that he can be treated. Even if the customer says, he doesn’t have an infection in his hair, our personnels will still do their work to make sure everything is okay.<br><b>POST GRADUATA</b>We have a class where we teach people who are willing to learn how to barber and get employed into our shop. This initiative is to help reduce the rate of unemployment in the community<br>Wrldfamouskid64 on Twitter, Worldfamouskid064 on Instagram</u></p>
